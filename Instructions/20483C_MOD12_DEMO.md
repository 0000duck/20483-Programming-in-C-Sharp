### Demonstration: Specifying the Data to Include in the Grades Report Lab

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles

#### Demonstration Steps

1.  Open the Grades.sln solution from the
    [Repository Root]\\Mod12\\Labfiles\\Solution\\Exercise 2 folder.

2.  In the **Grades.Utilities** project, open IncludeInReport.cs.

3.  Locate the **IncludeInReportAttribute** class definition, and then explain
    to students that in Exercise 1, they will make this class an attribute class
    and define its members.

4.  In the **Grades.WPF** project, open Data.cs.

5.  Locate the **LocalGrade** class, and then point out to students the
    **IncludeInReport** attributes on the **SubjectName**, **AssessmentDate**,
    **Assessment**, and **Comments** properties.

6.  In the **Grades.Utilities** project, open IncludeInReport.cs.

7.  Locate the **FormatField** struct, and then explain to students that in
    Exercise 2, they will define this struct to specify the formatting to apply
    to an item.

8.  In the **IncludeProcessor** class, locate the **GetItemsToInclude** method.

9.  Explain to students that they will add code to this method to find all of
    the public fields and properties in the **dataForReport** object and process
    each item that is tagged with the **IncludeInReport** attribute to format it
    correctly and include it in the report.

10. In the **Grades.WPF** project, in the **Views** folder, open
    StudentProfile.xaml.cs.

11. Locate the **GenerateStudentReport** method, and then explain to students
    that they add code to this method to use the **IncludeProcessor** class to
    determine which fields in the **Grade** object are tagged with the
    **IncludeInReport** attribute, format them appropriately, and include them
    in the report.

12. Explain to students that they will use the Strong Name tool to generate a
    key pair and sign the **Grades.Utilities** assembly with the key pair and
    then host the assembly in the GAC.

13. Finally, they will generate a report and check that the correct properties
    are included in the report and the formatting is correctly applied.

14. Close Visual Studio.
