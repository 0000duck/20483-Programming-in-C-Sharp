# Module 4: Creating Classes and Implementing Type-Safe Collections

# Lesson 1: Creating Classes

### Demonstration: Comparing Reference Types and Value Types

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483D directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles

#### Demonstration Steps

1.  Open **Visual Studio 2017**.
2.  In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click
    **Project**.
3.  In the **New Project** dialog box, in the **Templates** list, click **Visual
    C\#**, and then in the **Project Type** list, click **Console Application**.
4.  In the **Name** text box, type **ValuesAndReferences**
5.  In the **Location** text box, set the location to **Allfiles\\Mod04\\Democode**,
    and then click **OK**.
6. Within the **ValuesAndReferences** namespace, add the following code:
    ```cs
    struct MyStruct
    {
       public int Contents;
    }
    ```
7.	Immediately below the code you just added, add the following code:
    ```cs
    class MyClass
    {
       public int Contents = 0;
    }
    ```
8.	Within the **Program** class, within the **Main** method, add the following code:
    ```cs
    MyStruct struct1 = new MyStruct();
    MyStruct struct2 = struct1;
    struct2.Contents = 100;

    MyClass class1 = new MyClass();
    MyClass class2 = class1;
    class2.Contents = 100;

    Console.WriteLine("Value types: {0}, {1}", struct1.Contents, struct2.Contents);
    Console.WriteLine("Reference types: {0}, {1}", class1.Contents, class2.Contents);
    ```
9.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Start without Debugging**. The console window
    shows the following output:
    ```cs
    Value types: 0, 100
    Reference types: 100, 100
    ```
10.	Press Enter to close the console window.
11.	Close Visual Studio 2017.
