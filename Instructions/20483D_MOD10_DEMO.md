# Module 10:   Improving Application Performance and Responsiveness

# Lesson 2:  Performing Operations Asynchronously

### Demonstration: Using the Tak Parallel Library to Invoke APM Operations

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483D directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles
2. Navigate to **Allfiles\Mod10\Democode\Starter**, and then open the **APMTasks.sln** file.

#### Demonstration Steps

1.  On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.
2.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
3.  In the text box, type **http://www.fourthcoffee.com**, and then click
    **Check URL**.
4.  Notice that the label displays the message **The URL returned the following
    status code: OK**.
5.  Close the **MainWindow** window.
6.  In Solution Explorer, expand **MainWindow.xaml**, and then double-click
    **MainWindow.xaml.cs**.
7. Review the code in the **MainWindow** class:
    -  Notice that the **btnCheckUrl_Click** method creates an
        **HttpWebRequest** object and then calls the **BeginGetResponse**
        method.
    -  Notice that the **BeginGetResponse** method specifies the
        **ResponseCallback** method as an asynchronous callback method.
    -  Notice that the **ResponseCallback** method calls the
        **HttpWebResponse.EndGetResponse** method to get the result of the web
        request and then updates the UI.
8. Delete the **ResponseCallback** method.
9. Modify the **btnCheckUrl_Click** method declaration to include the **async**
    modifier as follows:
    ```cs
    private async void btnCheckUrl_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    ```
10.	In the **btnCheckUrl_Click** method, delete the following line of code: 
    ```cs
    request.BeginGetResponse(new AsyncCallback(ResponseCallback), request);
    ```
11.	Add the following code in place of the line you just deleted:
    ```cs
    HttpWebResponse response = await Task<WebResponse>.Factory.FromAsync    (request.BeginGetResponse, request.EndGetResponse, request) as HttpWebResponse;
    lblResult.Content = String.Format("The URL returned the following status code: {0}  ", response.StatusCode);
    ```
12.  Notice that the **MainWindow** class is now far more simple and concise.
13.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
14.  In the text box, type **http://www.fourthcoffee.com**, and then click
    **Check URL**.
15.  Notice that the label displays the message **The URL returned the following
    status code: OK**.
16.  Notice that the application works in exactly the same way as before.
17.  Close the **MainWindow** window, and then close Visual Studio.


# Lesson 3:  Synchronizing Concurrent Access to Data

### Demonstration:  Using Lock Statements

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483D directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles
2. Navigate to **Allfiles\Mod10\Democode\Starter**, and then open the **Locking.sln** file.


#### Demonstration Steps

1.  In Solution Explorer, double-click **Coffee.cs**.
2.  Review the **Coffee** class, paying particular attention to the
    **MakeCoffees** method.
3.  Notice how the **MakeCoffees** method uses a **lock** statement to prevent
    concurrent access to the critical code.
4.  In Solution Explorer, double-click **Program.cs**.
5.  In the **Program** class, review the **Main** method.
6.  Notice how the **Main** method uses a **Parallel.For** loop to
    simultaneously place 100 orders for between one and 100 coffees.
7. On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.
8. On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Debugging**.
9. Review the console window output, and notice that the application keeps
    track of stock levels effectively.
10. Press Enter to close the console window.
11. In the **Coffee** class, comment out the following line of code:
    ```cs
    lock (coffeeLock)
    ```
12.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Debugging**.
13.  Notice that the application throws an exception with the message **Stock
    cannot be negative!**
14.  Explain that this is due to concurrent access to the critical code section
    in the **MakeCoffees** method.
15.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugging**.
16.  Close Visual Studio.
