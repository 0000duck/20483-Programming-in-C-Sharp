### this document is missing the first demo of Lesson 1: "Creating an Entity Data Model". we need to port it from the docx file (older version of it) ###
### Demonstration: Reading and Modifying Data in an EDM

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483D directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles
2. Navigate to **Allfiles\Mod07\Democode\Demo2\FourthCoffee.Employees**, and then open the **FourthCoffee.Employees.sln** file.


#### Demonstration Steps

1.  In Solution Explorer, expand **FourthCoffee.Employees**, and then
    double-click **Program.cs**.
2.  Review the definition of the **DBContext** variable.
3.  Review the code in the **PrintEmployeesList** method that uses the
    **DBContext** variable to access the data in the EDM.
4.  Review the code in the **Main** method that uses the **First** extension
    method to retrieve an employee and then modifies that employee’s
    **LastName** property.
5.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
6.  Verify that the employees list is displayed, and then press Enter.
7. Verify that the employee named “Diane Prescott” is now named “Diane
    Forsyth,” and then press Enter.
8. Press Enter to close the application.


# Lesson 2:  Querying Data by Using LINQ

### Demonstration: Querying Data

#### Preparation Steps

2. Navigate to **Allfiles\Mod07\Democode\Demo3\FourthCoffee.Employees**, and then open the **FourthCoffee.Employees.sln** file.



#### Demonstration Steps

1.  In Solution Explorer, expand **FourthCoffee.Employees**, and then
    double-click **Program.cs**.
2.  Review the LINQ code in each of the methods.
3.  On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.
4.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.

    then press Enter.
6.  Repeat step 12 for each of the following methods:
    -  **FilteringDataByRow**
    -  **FilteringDataByColumn**
7. Press Enter to close the application.
8. In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, click **Close Solution**.
