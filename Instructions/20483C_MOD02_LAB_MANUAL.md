# Module 2: Creating Methods, Handling Exceptions, and Monitoring Applications

# Lab: Extending the Class Enrollment Application Functionality

#### Scenario

You have been asked to refactor the code that you wrote in the lab exercises for module 1 into separate methods to avoid the duplication of code in the Class Enrollment Application.

Also, you have been asked to write code that validates the student information that the user enters and to enable the updated student information to be written back to the database, handling any errors that may occur.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
-	Refactor code to facilitate reusability.
-	Write Visual C# code that validates data entered by a user.
-	Write Visual C# code that saves changes back to a database.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **90 minutes**


### Exercise 1: Refactoring the Enrollment Code

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will refactor the existing code to avoid writing duplicate code.

The application currently enables a user to edit a student’s details by pressing Enter, but you now want them to also be able to initiate the edit process by double-clicking on a student in the list. You will begin by creating a new method that contains the code for editing a student’s details. This will avoid duplicating and maintaining the code in both event handlers. You will then call the new method from both the **studentsList_MouseDoubleClick** and **StudentsList_Keydown** events. While doing this, you also decide to refactor the code for adding and deleting students into separate methods, so that it can be called from other parts of the application if the need arises. You will then run the application and verify that users can press Enter or double-click on a student to edit the student’s details, can press Insert to add a new student, and can press Delete to remove a student.


#### Task 1: Copy the code for editing a student into the studentsList_MouseDoubleClick event handler

1.	Start the MSL-TMG1 virtual machine if it is not already running. 
2.	Start the 20483B-SEA-DEV11 virtual machine and log on as **Student** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**.
3.	Start File Explorer, navigate to the **[Repository Root]\Mod02\Labfiles\Databases** folder, and then run **SetupSchoolDB.cmd**.
4.	Close File Explorer.
5.	Start Visual Studio and from the **[Repository Root]\Mod02\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 1** folder, open the **School.sln** solution. 
6.	In the code for the **MainWindow.xaml.cs** window, in the **studentsList_KeyDown** event, locate the code for editing student details which is in the **case Key.Enter** block.
7.	Copy the code in this block to the clipboard and then paste it into the **StudentsList_MouseDoubleClick** method.


#### Task 2: Run the application and verify that the user can now double-click a student to edit their details

1.	Build the solution and resolve any compilation errors.
2.	Change **Kevin Liu’s** last name to **Cook** by pressing Enter in the main application window.
3.	Verify that the updated data is copied back to the students list and that the **Save Changes** button is now enabled.
4.	Change **George Li’s** name to **Darren Parker** by double-clicking on his row in the main application window.
5.	Verify that the updated data is copied back to the student list.
6.	Close the application.


#### Task 3: Use the Analyze Solution for Code Clones wizard to detect the duplicated code.

1.	On the **Analyze** menu, click **Analyze Solution for Code Clones**.
2.	In the **Code Clone Analysis Results** window, expand **Exact Match**. 
3.	Using the results of the analysis in the **Code Clone Analysis Results**          window, refactor the duplicated code into a method called **editStudent**         that takes a **Student** as a parameter. 

4.	Call this method from the **studentsList_MouseDoubleClick** and **studentsList_KeyDown** methods. 

#### Task 4: Refactor the logic that adds and deletes a student into the addNewStudent and deleteStudent methods.

1.	Refactor the code in the **case Key.Insert** code block in the                    **studentsList_KeyDown** method into a method called **addNewStudent** that       takes no parameters.
2.	Call this method from the case **Key.Insert** code block in the                   **studentsList_KeyDown** method.
3.	Refactor the code in the **case Key.Delete** code block in the                    **studentsList_KeyDown** method into a method called **removeStudent** that       takes a **Student** as a parameter.
4.	Call this method from the case **Key.Delete** code block in the                   **studentsList_KeyDown** method.

#### Task 5: Verify that students can still be added and removed from the application.

1.	Build the solution and resolve any compilation errors.
2.	Run the application.
3.	Add a new student by pressing Insert to display the New Student for Class 3C      window, and verify that it contains no data. 
4.	Enter details for **Dominik Dubicki**, whose date of birth is **02/03/2006**,     and verify that the new student is added to the students list. 
5.	Delete the student **Run Liu** and verify that the prompt window appears and      the student is removed from the student list. 
6.	Close the application. 

#### Task 6: Debug the application and step into the new method calls.

1.	Add a breakpoint at the start of the switch statement in the                      studentsList_KeyDown method.
2.	Debug the application.
3.	Edit the row for **Kevin Liu** by pressing Enter.
4.	Step over the code, watching the **Call Stack** window and **Locals** window,     until you reach the **editStudent** method call, and then step into that          method.
5.	Step out of the **editStudent** method.
6.	Cancel editing the student’s details, and then continue debugging.
7.	Add a new student by pressing Insert.
8.	Step over the code until you reach the **addNewStudent** method call, and         then step into that method.
9.	Step out of the **addNewStudent** method.
10.	Cancel adding a new student, and then continue debugging.
11.	Delete the row for **George Li** by pressing Delete.
12.	Step over the code until you reach the **removeStudent** method call, and         then step into that method.
13.	Step out of the **removeStudent** method.
14.	Cancel deleting the student.
15.	Stop debugging the application.
16.	In Visual Studio, delete all breakpoints and then close the solution.

>**Results** : After completing this exercise, you should have updated the application to refactor duplicate code into reusable methods.



### Exercise 2: Validating Student Information

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will write code that validates the information that a user enters for a student. 
Up until this point, almost anything can be entered as student data, and fields can be left blank. This means, for example, that a student could be added to the student list with no last name or with an invalid date of birth.
You will write code to check that when adding or editing a student, the first name and last name fields for the student contain data. You will also write code to check that the date of birth entered is a valid date and that the student is at least five years old. Finally, you will run the application and test your validation code.

#### Task 1: Run the application and observe that student details that are not valid can be entered.

1.	In Visual Studio, from the **[Repository Root]\Mod02\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 2** folder,       open the **School.sln** solution.
2.	Build the solution and resolve any compilation errors.
3.	Run the application.
4.	Press Insert to display the new student window.
5.	Leave the **First Name** and **Last Name** boxes empty, and type                  **10/06/3012** in the **Date of Birth** box.
6.	Click **OK** and verify that a new row has been added to the student list,        containing a blank first name, blank last name, and a negative age.
7.	Close the application.

#### Task 2: Add code to validate the first name and last name fields

1.	In the **ok_Click** method in **StudentForm.xaml.cs** code, add a statement       to check if the First Name box is empty.
2.	If it is empty, display a message box with a caption of **Error** containing      the text **The student must have a first name**, and then exit the method.
3.	In the **ok_Click** method in **StudentForm.xaml.cs** code, add a statement       to check if the **Last Name** box is empty. 
4.	If it is empty, display a message box with a caption of **Error** containing      the text **The student must have a last name**, and then exit the click           method. 

#### Task 3: Add code to validate the date of birth

1.	In the **ok_Click** method in **StudentForm.xaml.cs** code, add a statement       to check if the **Date of Birth** box is empty.
2.	If the entered date is invalid, display a message box with a caption of           **Error** containing the text **The date of birth must be a valid date**, and     then exit the method.
3.	In the **ok_Click** method in **StudentForm.xaml.cs** code, add a statement       to calculate the student’s age in years, and check if the age is less than        five years. 
4.	If the age is less than five years, display a message box with a caption of       **Error** containing the text **The student must at least 5 years old**, and      then exit the method. Use the following formula to calculate the age in years.
    Age in years = age in days / 365.25

#### Task 4: Run the application and verify that student information is now validated correctly.

1.	Build the solution and resolve any compilation errors.
2.	Run the application.
3.	Press Insert to display the new student window. 
4.	Leave the **First Name, Last Name**, and **Date of Birth** boxes empty. 
5.	Click **OK**, verify that an error message appears containing the text **The student must have a first name**, then close the error message box.
6.	Type **Darren** into the **First Name** box, and then click **OK**. 
7.	Verify that an error message appears containing the text **The student must have a last name**, and then close the error message box. 
8.	Type **Parker** into the **Last Name** box, and then click **OK**. 
9.	Verify that an error message appears containing the text **The date of birth must be a valid date**, and then close the error message box. 
10.	Type **10/06/3012** into the **Date of Birth** box, and then click **OK**. 
11.	Verify that an error message appears containing the text **The student must       be at least 5 years old**, and then close the error message box. 
12.	Amend the date to **10/06/2006**, click **OK**, and then verify that Darren Parker is added to the student list with an age appropriate to the current date. 
13.	Close the application. 
14.	In Visual Studio, close the solution. 

>**Results** : After completing this exercise, student data will be validated before it is saved.


### Exercise 3: Saving Changes to the Class List

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will write code that saves changes in the student list to the database.

Every time the user closes and opens the application, they are presented with the original student list as it existed when they first ran the application, regardless of any changes they may have made. You will write code to save changes back to the database when the user clicks the **Save Changes** button. You will then add exception handling code to catch concurrency, update, and general exceptions, and handle the exceptions gracefully. Finally, you will run your application and verify that changes you make to student data are persisted between application sessions.

#### Task 1: Verify that data changes are not persisted to the database

1.	In Visual Studio, from the **[Repository Root]\Mod02\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 3** folder,       open the **School.sln** solution.
2.	Build the solution and resolve any compilation errors.
3.	Run the application.
4.	Change **Kevin Liu’s** last name to **Cook** by pressing Enter in the main        application window.
5.	Verify that the updated data is copied to the student list and that the           **Save Changes** button is enabled.
6.	Click **Save Changes**.
7.	Delete the student **George Li**, and then click the **Save Changes** button.
8.	Close the application.
9.	Run the application again and verify that it displays the original list of        students, without the changes that you just made.
10.	Close the application.

#### Task 2: Add code to save changes back to the database

1.	In the **MainWindow.xaml.cs** code bring the **System.Data** and                  **System.Data.Objects** namespaces into scope.
2.	Add code to perform the following tasks when a user clicks **Save Changes**: 
    -	Call the SaveChanges method of the schoolContext object.
    -	Disable the Save Changes button.


#### Task 3: Add exception handling to the code to catch concurrency, update, and general exceptions.

1.	Enclose the lines of code that call the **SaveChanges** method of the             **schoolContext** object and disable the **Save Changes** button in a **try**     block.
2.	Below the **try** block, add a **catch** block to catch any                       **OptimisticConcurrencyException** exceptions that may occur.
3.	In the **catch** block, add the following code:
    ```cs
        // If the user has changed the same students earlier, then overwrite their changes with the new data
        this.schoolContext.Refresh(RefreshMode.StoreWins, schoolContext.Students);
        this.schoolContext.SaveChanges();
    ```

4.	Add another **catch** block to catch any **UpdateException** exceptions that      may occur, storing the exception in a variable named **uEx**. 
5.	In the **catch** block, add the following code: 
    ```cs
    // If some sort of database exception has occurred, then display the reason for the exception and rollback
    MessageBox.Show(uEx.InnerException.Message, "Error saving changes");
    this.schoolContext.Refresh(RefreshMode.StoreWins, schoolContext.Students);
    ```
6.	Add another **catch** block to catch any other type of exception that might       occur, storing the exception in a variable named **ex**. 
7.	In the **catch** block, add the following code: 
    ```cs
        // If some other exception occurs, report it to the user
              MessageBox.Show(ex.Message, "Error saving changes");
              this.schoolContext.Refresh(RefreshMode.ClientWins, schoolContext.Students);
    ```
>**Results** : After completing this exercise, modified student data will be saved to the database.
