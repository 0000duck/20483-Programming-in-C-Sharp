# Lesson 1: Creating and Invoking Methods

### Demonstration: Creating, Invoking, and Debugging Methods

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483D directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles
2. Navigate to **Allfiles/Mod02/Democode/Starter/FourthCoffee.MethodTestHarness**, and then open the **FourthCoffee.MethodTestHarness.sln** file.

#### Demonstration Steps

1.	In Visual Studio, on the **View** menu, click **Task List**.
2.	In the **Task List** window, in the **Categories** list, click **Comments**.
3.	Double-click the **TODO: 01: Define the Initialize method.** task.
4.	In the code editor, click in the blank line below the comment, and then type the following code:

    return
        !string.IsNullOrEmpty(path);
    } 
    ```
5.	In the **Task List** window, double-click the **TODO: 02: Invoke the Initialize method.** task.
6.	In the code editor, click in the blank line below the comment, and then type the following code:
    ```cs
    var isInitialized= Initialize();
    ```
7.	Right-click the call to the **Initialize** method, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
8.	On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.
9.	On the **Debug** menu, click Start **Debugging**.
10.	Press F11 to step into the **Initialize** method.
11.	Press F10 to step to the **GetApplicationPath** method call.
12.	Press F10 to step over the **GetApplicationPath** method call.
13.	Press Shift+F11 to step out of the **Initialize** method.
14.	Press F10 to step over the **Initialize** method call.
15.	Hover over the **isInitialized** variable, 
and verify that the value returned is **true**.
16.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugging**.
