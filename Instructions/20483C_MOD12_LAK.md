# Lab: Specifying the Data to Include in the Grades Report

### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **75 minutes**

### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles


### Exercise 1: Creating and Applying the IncludeInReport attribute

#### Task 1: Write the code for the IncludeInReportAttribute class.


1.  Start File Explorer, navigate to the **[Repository Root]\\Mod12\\Labfiles\\Databases**
    folder, and then run **SetupSchoolGradesDB.cmd**.
2.  Close File Explorer.
3.  Start Visual Studio, and then open the Grades.sln solution from the
    [Repository Root]\\Mod12\\Labfiles\\Starter\\Exercise 1 folder.
4.  Set the following projects to start without debugging at startup:
5.  **Grades.Web**
6.  **Grades.WPF**
7.	In the Grades.Utilities project, in the **IncludeInReport.cs** class, add code to specify that the **IncludeInReportAttribute** class is an attribute class.
8. Add code to specify that the possible targets to which the **IncludeInReport**
attribute can be applied are fields and properties and that the attribute can be
applied only once to each entity.
9. In the **IncludeInReportAttribute** class, define a private Boolean variable
named **\_include** to hold the value of the attribute.
10. In the **IncludeInReportAttribute** class, define two public read/write Boolean properties named **Underline** and **Bold**.
11. In the **IncludeInReportAttribute** class, define a public read/write string
property named **Label**.
12.  In the **IncludeInReportAttribute** class, create a default constructor that
    sets the properties as follows:
     -   \_include: **true**
     -   Underline: **false**
     -   Bold: **false**
     -   Label: **string.Empty**
13.  Create another constructor that takes a Boolean parameter named
    **includeInReport** and sets the properties as follows:
     -   \_include: **\_includeInReport**
     -   Underline: **false**
     -   Bold: **false**
     -   Label: **string.Empty**



#### Task 2: Apply the IncludeInReportAttribute attribute to the appropriate properties.

1.	In the Grades.WPF project, in the Data.cs file, in the **LocalGrade** class, add the **IncludeInReport** attribute to the appropriate properties of the **LocalGrade** class as follows:
    -	**SubjectName** property:
        -	Label: **Subject Name**
        -	Bold: **true**
        -	Underline: **true**
    -	**AssessmentDate** property:
        -	Label: **Date**
    -	**Assessment** property:
        -	Label: **Grade**
    -	**Comments** property:
        -	Label: **Comments**


#### Task 3: Build the application and review the metadata for the LocalGrades class.

1.  Build the solution, and then resolve any compilation errors.
2.  Use the IL DASM utility to examine the metadata of the **LocalGrades** class
    in the **Grades.WPF.exe** assembly. The IL DASM utility is located in the
    C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v8.0A\\bin\\NETFX 4.0
    Tools folder, and the **Grades.WPF.exe** assembly is located in the
    [Repository Root]\\Mod12\\Labfiles\\Starter\\Exercise 1\\Grades.WPF\\bin\\Debug folder.
3. Verify that the **IncludeInReport** attribute has been applied to the specified
properties in the class.




>**Result :** After completing this exercise, the **Grades.Utilities** assembly will contain
an **IncludeInReport** custom attribute and the **Grades** class will contain
fields and properties that are tagged with that attribute.



### Exercise 2: Updating the Report

#### Task 1: Implement a static helper class called IncludeProcessor.

1.	In Visual Studio, open the Grades.sln solution from the [Repository Root]\Mod12\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 2 folder.
2.	Set the following projects to start without debugging at startup:
    -	**Grades.Web**
    -	**Grades.WPF**
3.	In the Grades.Utilities project, open IncludeInReport.cs.
4.	Locate the **FormatField** struct declaration, and then add two string members named **Value** and **Label** and two Boolean members named **IsBold** and **IsUnderlined**. 
5.	In the **GetItemsToInclude** method of the **IncludeProcessor** class, after the variable declarations, add code to find all of the public fields and properties in the **dataForReport** object and use the **AddRange** method add them to the **fieldsAndProperties** list.
6.	Add code to iterate through all of the public fields and properties.
7.	In the loop, add code to retrieve all the custom attributes applied to an item.
8.	Then use the **Array.Find** method to test whether any of the custom attributes applied to the item are the **IncludeInReport** attribute.
9.	At the end of the loop, add code to find the value of the item that is tagged with the **IncludeInReport** attribute.
10.	At the end of the loop, add code to construct a **FormatField** item containing the value of the item and the label, bold, and underline values from the attribute.
11.	At the end of the loop, add code to add the **FormatField** item to the collection to be returned.



#### Task 2: Update the report functionality for the StudentProfile view.

1. In the **Grades.WPF** project, in the **StudentProfile.xaml.cs** class, in the
**GenerateStudentReport** method, at the start of the **foreach** loop, add code
to use the **IncludeProcessor** class to determine which fields in the **Grade**
object are tagged with the **IncludeInReport** attribute.
2.	Add code to include each tagged item in the output, using the format that is specified by the properties of the **IncludeInReport** attribute for each item.


#### Task 3: Build and test the application.

1.  Build the solution, and then resolve any compilation errors.
2.  Run the application.
3.  Log on as **vallee** with a password of **password99**.
4.  Create and save a grades report for Kevin Liu.
5.  Close the application, and then close the solution.
6.  Open the grades report that you just created in Word and verify that the
    document contains a correctly formatted report.
7.  Close Word.


>**Result :** After completing this exercise, the application will be updated to use reflection to include only the tagged fields and properties in the grades report.


### Exercise 3: Storing the Grades.Utilities Assembly Centrally (If Time Permits)

#### Task 1: Sign the Grades.Utilities assembly and deploy it to the GAC.

1.	In Visual Studio, open the Grades.sln solution from the [Repository Root]\Mod12\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 3 folder.
2.	Set the following projects to start without debugging at startup:
    -	**Grades.Web**
    -	**Grades.WPF**
3.	Run the **VS2012 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt** window as Administrator.
4.	Run the Sn.exe utility to create a key pair file named **GradesKey.snk** in the [Repository Root]\Mod12\Labfiles\Starter folder.
5.	In Visual Studio, set the properties of the Grades.Utilities project to use the key pair that you have just created to sign the assembly.
6.	Build the solution, and then resolve any compilation errors.
7.	At the command prompt, use the Gacutil utility to add the **Grades.Utilities** assembly to the GAC. 
8.	Close the **Command Prompt** window.



#### Task 2: Reference the Grades.Utilities assembly in the GAC from the application.

1.	In Visual Studio, remove the current reference to the Grades.Utilities project from the Grades.WPF project.
2.	Add a new reference to the signed **Grades.Utilities.dll** assembly.
3.	Build the solution, and then resolve any compilation errors.
4.	Run the application. 
5.	Log on as **vallee** with a password of **password99**. 
6.	Create and save a grades report for Kevin Liu. 
7.	Close the application, and then close the solution. 
8.	Open the grades report that you just created in Word and verify that the document contains a correctly formatted report. 
9.	Close Word. 


>**Result :** After completing this exercise, you will have a signed version of the **Grades.Utilities** assembly deployed to the GAC.
