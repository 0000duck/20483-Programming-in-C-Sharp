# Lesson 1:  Using XAML to Design a User Interface

### Demonstration: Using Design View to Create a XAML UI

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483D directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles

#### Demonstration Steps

1.  Click **Visual Studio 2017**.
2.  In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click
    **Project**.
3.  In the **New Project** dialog box, in the **Templates** list, click **Visual
    C\#**, and then in the **Project Type** list, click **WPF Application**.
4.  In the **Name** box, type **DesignView**.
5.  In the **Location** text box, set the location to **Allfiles\\Mod09\\Democode**,
    and then click **OK**.
6.  In the XAML pane, in the **Window** element, change the value of the
    **Title** attribute to **Order Your Coffee Here**.
7.  Add the following markup between the opening and closing **Grid** tags:
    ```xml
    <Grid.RowDefinitions>
       <RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
       <RowDefinition Height="*" />
    </Grid.RowDefinitions>
    ```
8.  Open the **Toolbox** pane, expand **Common WPF Controls**, and then
    double-click **Button**.
9.  On the design surface, drag the button towards the top of the screen until a
    message displays **Press Tab to place inside row 0**. Press **Tab**, and
    then release the button.
10.  In the XAML pane, in the **Button** element, change the value of the
    **Content** attribute to **Make Me a Coffee!**.
11.  Change the value of the **HorizontalAlignment** attribute to **Center**.
12.  Change the value of the **Width** attribute to **Auto**.
13.  In the **Properties** window, ensure the button is selected, and then in the
    **Name** box, type **btnGetCoffee**.
14.  In the **Toolbox** pane, double-click **Label**.
15.  On the design surface, drag the label to anywhere in the lower row of the
    **Grid**.
16.  In the XAML pane, in the **Label** element, change the value of the
    **Content** attribute to an empty string.
17. Change the value of the **HorizontalAlignment** attribute to **Center**.
18. In the **Properties** window, ensure the label is selected, and then in the
    **Name** text box, type **lblResult**.
19. On the design surface, double-click **Make Me a Coffee!**.
20. Notice that Visual Studio automatically creates an event handler method and
    switches to the code-behind page.
21. In the **btnGetCoffee_Click** method, add the following code:
    ```cs
    lblResult.Content = "Your coffee is on its way.";
    ```
22.  On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
23.  In the **Order Your Coffee Here** window, click **Make Me a Coffee!**.
24.  Notice that the label displays a message.
25.  Close the **Order Your Coffee Here** window, and then close Visual Studio.
