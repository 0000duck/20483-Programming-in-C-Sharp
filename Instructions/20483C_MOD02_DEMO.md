# Module 2: Creating Methods, Handling Exceptions, and Monitoring Applications

# Lesson 1: Creating and Invoking Methods

### Demonstration: Creating, Invoking, and Debugging Methods

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles
2. Navigate to **Allfiles/Mod02/Democode/Starter/FourthCoffee.MethodTestHarness**, and then open the **FourthCoffee.MethodTestHarness.sln** file.

#### Demonstration Steps

1.	In Visual Studio, on the **View** menu, click **Task List**.
2.	In the **Task List** window, double-click the **TODO: 01: Define the Initialize method.** task.
3.	In the code editor, click in the blank line below the comment, and then type the following code:
    ```cs
    bool Initialize()
    {
    var path = GetApplicationPath();

    return
        !string.IsNullOrEmpty(path);
    } 
    ```
4.	In the **Task List** window, double-click the **TODO: 02: Invoke the Initialize method.** task.
5.	In the code editor, click in the blank line below the comment, and then type the following code:
    ```cs
    var isInitialized= Initialize();
    ```
6.	Right-click the call to the **Initialize** method, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
7.	On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.
8.	On the **Debug** menu, click Start **Debugging**.
9.	Press F11 to step into the **Initialize** method.
10.	Press F10 to step to the **GetApplicationPath** method call.
11.	Press F10 to step over the **GetApplicationPath** method call.
12.	Press Shift+F11 to step out of the **Initialize** method.
13.	Press F10 to step over the **Initialize** method call.
14.	Hover over the **isInitialized** variable, 
and verify that the value returned is **true**.
15.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugging**.
16.	On the **File** menu, click **Close Solution**.


# Lesson 4: Monitoring Applications

### Demonstration: Extending the Class Enrollment Application Functionlity Lab

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles

#### Demonstration Steps

1.  Open the **School.sln** solution from the
    [Repository Root]\\Mod02\\Labfiles\\Solution\\Exercise 3 folder.
2.  Open **MainWindow.xaml.cs** and locate the **studentsList_KeyDown** method.
3.  Explain to students that in Exercise 1 they will refactor the code that they
    added to this method in Lab 1 into separate methods that can be called from
    multiple locations.
4.  Show students the refactored code in the **EditStudent**, **AddNewStudent**,
    and **RemoveStudent** methods.
5.  Show students the **studentsList_MouseDoubleClick** method and explain that
    the call to the **editStudent** method also uses the refactored code.
6.  Open **StudentForm.xaml.cs** and locate the **ok_Click** method.
7.  Explain to students that in Exercise 2 they will add code to this method to
    check that user input is valid before returning to the main form.
8.  Open **MainWindow.xaml.cs** and locate the **saveChanges_Click** method.
9.  Explain to students that in Exercise 3 they will add code to save the
    changes back to the database and handle any errors that might occur.
10. Run the application and double-click a student to edit their details. Point
    out to students that the **studentsList_MouseDoubleClick** method calls the
    refactored **EditStudent** method.
11. Enter data that is not valid in one of the fields, and then show students
    the error message that appears.
12. Enter valid data, and then in the main window, click **Save Changes**.
13. Close the application.
14. Run the application again and show that the changes they made have been
    saved to the database.
15. Close the application, and then close Visual Studio.
