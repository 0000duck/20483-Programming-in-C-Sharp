6.	In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
7.	In the **Open Project** dialog box, browse to the **E:\Mod02\Democode\Starter\FourthCoffee.MethodTestHarness** folder, click **FourthCoffee.MethodTestHarness.sln**, and then click Open.
8.	In Visual Studio, on the **View** menu, click **Task List**.
9.	In the **Task List** window, in the **Categories** list, click **Comments**.
10.	Double-click the **TODO: 01: Define the Initialize method.** task.

    {
    var path = GetApplicationPath();

    return
        !string.IsNullOrEmpty(path);
    } 
    ```
12.	In the **Task List** window, double-click the **TODO: 02: Invoke the Initialize method.** task.
13.	In the code editor, click in the blank line below the comment, and then type the following code:
    ```cs
    var isInitialized= Initialize();
    ```
14.	Right-click the call to the **Initialize** method, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
15.	On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.
16.	On the **Debug** menu, click Start **Debugging**.
17.	Press F11 to step into the **Initialize** method.
18.	Press F10 to step to the **GetApplicationPath** method call.
19.	Press F10 to step over the **GetApplicationPath** method call.
20.	Press Shift+F11 to step out of the **Initialize** method.
21.	Press F10 to step over the **Initialize** method call.
22.	Hover over the **isInitialized** variable, 
and verify that the value returned is **true**.
23.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugging**.
24.	On the **File** menu, click **Close Solution**.
