# Lesson 3:  Performing I/O by Using Streams

### Demonstration: Generating the Grades Report Lab

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles

#### Demonstration Steps

1. Open the **GradesPrototype.sln** solution from the
    **[Repository Root]\\Mod06\\Labfiles\\Solution\\Exercise 3** folder.
2. In the **Views** folder, open **StudentProfile.xaml** and point out that the
    user interface has been updated to include a **Save Report** button.
3. In the **Views** folder, open **StudentProfile.xaml.cs**, and locate the
    **SaveReport_Click** method.
4. Explain to students that during the lab they will add the code in this
    method to prompt the user for a filename to save the report as, and to call
    methods to generate, preview, and save the report.
5. In **StudentProfile.xaml.cs**, locate the **FormatAsXMLStream** method.
6. Explain to students that during Exercise 1 they will add the code in this
    method to generate an XML document in a **MemoryStream** object.
7. In **StudentProfile.xaml.cs**, locate the **FormatXMLData** method.
8. Explain to students that during Exercise 2 they will add the code in this
    method to format the XML data as a string and display it to the user.
9. Run the application, and log on as **vallee** with a password of
    **password99**.
10. View **Kevin Liu’s** report card and then click **Save Report** to generate
    the XML document.
11. Specify to save the file in the Documents folder by using the default name.
12. Review the XML data displayed in the message box, and then confirm that you
    want to save the file.
