# Lab: Specifying the Data to Include in the Grades Report


#### Scenario

You decide to update the Grades application to use custom attributes to define the fields and properties that should be included in a grade report and to format them appropriately. This will enable further reusability of the Microsoft Word reporting functionality.
You will host this code in the GAC to ensure that it is available to other applications that require its services. 


#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
-	Define custom attributes.
-	Use reflection to examine metadata at run time.
-	Sign an assembly and deploy it to the GAC.


### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **75 minutes**


### Exercise 1: Creating and Applying the IncludeInReport attribute


#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will create the **IncludeInReport** attribute to specify
the fields and the format of each field that is included in the grades report.

First, you will write code for the **IncludeInReportAttribute** class and define
the members that are contained in it. Next, you will apply the attribute to the
appropriate properties in the **LocalGrade** class in the Data.cs file. Finally,
you will build the application and then use the MSIL Disassembler utility (IL
DASM) to examine the metadata that the attribute generates.

### Exercise 2: Updating the Report

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will update the grades report to include fields and
properties only if they are tagged with the **IncludeInReport** attribute.

First, you will implement a method named **GetItemsToInclude** in a static
helper class called **IncludeProcessor** that implements the logic that is
necessary to discover the fields and properties that are tagged with the
**IncludeInReport** attribute. You will then update the code for the
**StudentProfile** view to include fields and properties in the report only if
they are tagged with the **IncludeInReport** attribute and to format them
appropriately.

### Exercise 3: Storing the Grades.Utilities Assembly Centrally (If Time Permits)

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will store the **Grades.Utilities** assembly in the GAC.
First, you will use Sn.exe to generate a key pair and then use the key pair to
sign the **Grades.Utilities** assembly. Next, you will use Gacutil.exe to add
the assembly to the GAC. You will then update the reference for the
**Grades.Utilities** assembly in the Grades.WPF project to use the new signed
assembly that is hosted in the GAC, and finally you will test the application to
ensure that the reports are correctly generated.
